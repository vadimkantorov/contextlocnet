We aim to localize objects in images using image-level supervision only.
Previous approaches to this problem mainly focus on discriminative object
regions and often fail to locate precise object boundaries. 
We address this problem by introducing two types of context-aware guidance models, {\em additive
} and {\em contrastive} models, that leverage their surrounding context regions to improve localization. 
%%
The additive model encourages the predicted object region to be
supported by its surrounding context region. 
The contrastive model encourages the
predicted object region to be outstanding from its surrounding context region.

Our approach benefits from the recent success of convolutional neural networks
for object recognition and extends Fast R-CNN to weakly supervised object localization.
Extensive experimental evaluation on the PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012 benchmarks shows that our context-aware approach significantly improves weakly supervised localization and detection.
